Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model is trained to distinguish between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to image classification tasks.

Features

	•	Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess image data for training and validation.
	•	Model Training: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the dataset.
	•	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s performance on a test dataset.
	•	Image Prediction: Predict whether a new image is of a cat or a dog.

Tech Stack

	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
	•	Dataset: Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset
