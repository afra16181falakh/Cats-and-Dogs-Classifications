## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model is trained to distinguish between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to image classification tasks.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load, preprocess, and augment image data for training and validation.
- **Model Training**: Implement a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model’s performance using accuracy, loss metrics, and visualizations.
- **Image Prediction**: Predict whether a new image is of a cat or a dog.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, OpenCV
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## Installation
To set up the environment and install dependencies, run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cats-dogs-classification.git
cd cats-dogs-classification

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` directory. The dataset should have the following structure:
```
data/
├── train/
│   ├── cats/
│   ├── dogs/
├── test/
│   ├── cats/
│   ├── dogs/
```

## Model Architecture
The CNN consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, batch normalization, and fully connected dense layers. The final layer uses a softmax activation function to classify images into two categories: **Cat** or **Dog**.

## Training the Model
To train the model, run:
```bash
python train.py
```
The script will:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Split the data into training and validation sets.
3. Train the CNN model.
4. Save the trained model for future inference.

## Evaluating the Model
To evaluate model performance, run:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
This script will generate accuracy and loss plots and display classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Making Predictions
To predict whether an image is of a cat or a dog, run:
```bash
python predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg
```

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately **X%** on the test dataset. Below is a sample confusion matrix and accuracy plot
